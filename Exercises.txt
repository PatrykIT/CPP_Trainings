Map exercises:

1. I would like some exercise which makes trainees use 3rd template argument (not default one).
	a) Give trainees a map with different values. Ask them to create a copy of that map, but with values in greater order.
	Probably most will copy the map and then call std::sort. As a correct answer, show them 3rd template.

2. Map iteration - ask class what is wrong with first iteration. When they will be looking for an answer, open en.cppreference.com with std::map, and tell them to look there.

At the end of training, ask:
How is map implemented?
What are pros and cons of this implementation (red-black tree)?









Performance tests.
